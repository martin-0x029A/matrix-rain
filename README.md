  --shell-file minimal.html \
  --preload-file matrix_font_subset.ttf \

The current version works only with the characters in the script. If you want to add more characters use Noto Sans CJK https://github.com/googlefonts/noto-cjk/raw/main/Sans/Variable/OTC/NotoSansMonoCJK-VF.ttf.ttc and compile only the ones you need to reduce the size of the file.

### Character Set Customization

The default version includes a subset of characters. To expand the character set:

1. Download [Noto Sans CJK](https://github.com/googlefonts/noto-cjk/raw/main/Sans/Variable/OTC/NotoSansMonoCJK-VF.ttf.ttc)
2. Select the characters you need
3. Create a subset font to maintain optimal file size
